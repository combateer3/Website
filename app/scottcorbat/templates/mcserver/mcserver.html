        This server is run on Paper, a fork of Spigot. As such, it supports Spigot plugins. There is also a hierarchy of
        roles
        delegated to trusted persons, namely Moderator and Admin. Everyone is made a member upon joining. A full list of
        the
        powers of each role, as well as members of each role are documented here for public knowledge. I will also
        provide
        an updated list of plugins currently used on the server.
